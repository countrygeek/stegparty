wandering around the fixional Minneapolis-esque town, i ran intoa Manga shop, and one of the Manga i found ended up influencing the arc-formerly-known-as-'aji.  the content of the exquisitely drawn b&w manga was a precise    [heath] - cross between Ghost in the Shell [2-parts], Aeon Flux [1-part], and the FPS game Marathon, who nobody here but dbauler's probably played in any form.  the part that reminded me of Marathon was the way the story itself was told - uplinks at     [heath] - infrequent intervals during which exposition was delivered, separated by long wordless empty sneaking-around-and sniping things phases.\ [much like the orig. liquid tv Aeon Flux].    [heath] - well, as i was waking up, what i gleaned from this dream was that the female spy in the ancient-looking futureistic setting was a member of an Order of Illuminated Assassins; not in the sense that they're all illuminated, but in the sense that no    [heath] - one of the Assassins are stupid or ignorant of the overarching ideals of Order.  these ideals are as follows: they seek to "disappear" physical manifestations of scientific knowledge.    [heath] - that was about all i got from my dream before i awoke, but i trnaslated it into the arc thus..:  there is a sect of shamen who are also cartographers in various senses [ie, also alchemists, writers; they map mental spaces as well as    [heath] - physical spaces].  they have a secret tongue and are also in charge of describing the relations between various branches of the common tongue, so that precise translation from one language / dialect to another is possible.    [heath] - they chart these correspondences and are keepers of them.  this Order of Assasins ups their ante a bit; they now have an enemy.  the Assassins actually only kill when something -- like, say, a person -- gets in the way of their attempt to     [heath] - stealthfully steal away the tomes and charts of knowledge from their original resting places.  it is said by the catDzanu [the mapper-shamen] that these Assassins destroy all of the work they steal, but this is probably untrue; each of the     [heath] - Assassins must *know* the languages spoken all around their world so they can travel easily between regions; they must know the lay of the land for the same reasons; and none of them are dumb.  so it's likely that the materials thus spirited away    [heath] - end up in some or several repositories somewhere.  perhaps only the most exemplary versions of certain concepts and charts are kept and the rest destroyed, those safeguarded versions then recopied and used to teach the Assassins.  their motives     [heath] - in this behavior are unclear [but i have some thoughts which i'm going to let simmer, the "vision" being so fresh].  the effect this has, though, on the advancment of culture is interesting.    [heath] - ...*** cris (cris@bermuda.io.com) has joined channel #scrytch    [cris] - heath - wanna bounce a timeline off you:    [cris] - louise escapes bethany medical,meets up w/harvey    [cris] - er i mean rraby    [cris] - they do the ext think into heath's dreams, this is where she is killed by the she who is also in heath's dreams    [cris] - at this point she iswandering around in ext and doesnt know it,, living a life she does not know is not real, she cannot put togewther the lack of context or history into anything meaningful    [cris] - being predisposed to suicdide anyway (have to get this in there b/c thats how she was written in the beginning of interlace)    [cris] - she tries to do herself in, hanging i spose, and fucks up & dies by accident (kinda like flying by distracting yourself before you hit the ground)    [cris] - then she is stuck back in ext, even more vivid .. this is where she starts to wander the desert, the ols She thing from this summer    [cris] - and that takes her to the caravan where she meets UP WITH sTELLA/hARVEY    [cris] - capslock    [cris] - and at the end of that series of pieces she motorcanoes into the aurora borealis and "dies"    [cris] - and then thats where we find her in the nautilus, coming awake and aware of courtney and cohen heading to the island    [cris] - it's rough but ill flesh it out better    [cris] - l8tr]*** Signoff: cris (Leaving)    [heath] - the piece of software that wanted to modify my system has an interesting concept behind it..    [heath] - but the manual is written in *very* broken english and i don't know if i trust it..    [heath] - oops* heath searches far and wide for summary pages ont he bantu languages*** cris (cris@xanadu.io.com) has joined channel #scrytch*** pfly (amir@discordia.weird.org) has joined channel #scrytch*** scotto (scotto@207.212.225.131) has joined channel #scrytch*** Signoff: cris (squoosh)*** yara (~yara@shaman.lycaeum.org) has joined channel #scrytch    [scotto] - yara    [yara] - hey    [yara] - i think with my next paycheck, i'm going to have to break downa nd buy some new cds    [scotto] - sounds dangerous    [yara] - i hate buying cds cuz i know what the difference is between the cost to produce and the $15.99 they want me to pay    [heath] - do what i do and shop used.    [heath] - my entire cd collection [well, 90% of it] is built on that foundation.  the other 10% are purchased new..    [heath] - special cases & all.    [yara] - i think i'd have a hard time finding the stuff i want used    [yara] - it's tough enough finding it new    [heath] - if you're that picky, yeah..  but if you found a really good used store, it can happen.  plus you get to listen to stuff too.  but i can see the concern.  aren't there online web cd places that sell at big discounts?    [heath] - [ah, btw, abby we shld discuss whether to keep you going wrt the irc work or have me take it if the mail's now just to be sent to xero;
