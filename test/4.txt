i said i didnt know what was going on re the attack    [cris] - what villan?    [yara] - in the attack on Infinitek--is there a villain?    [yara] - i was trying to figure out who might stop dbauler & i    [cris] - i thought it was you guys .. though i admit i cant recall you actually nailing the place    [pfly] - aren't scotto, slade, etc all heading that way?    [cris] - but it all got referred to in such a way i figured i read too fast to see that it was you all    [cris] - oooo, i gots an idea how to stop you two    [cris] - hee hee    [pfly] - there seems to be a whole menagnerie of characters lurking around infinitek these days    [cris] - the building itself is slipping focus a little, softening & becoming more organic    [cris] - perhaps it's time for tokyo to burn    [pfly] - it got bombed, but i'm still unclear on how much of it got destroyed    [cris] - who bombed it?    [yara] - ok. but who might stop us?    [yara] - Bomberman    [pfly] - bomberman!    [cris] - i thought he fucked up?    [yara] - he dropped the van on to it with lots of explosives    [pfly] - well... why are scotto, slade, etc, heading that way?    [yara] - that was the 1st time    [yara] - i dunno    [cris] - oh!  ok ..    [pfly] - there could easily be villians *inside*,... like the shadow aliens    [yara] - the 23 babies are trying to take it down by taking control of it, right?    [cris] - i need to read scotto & flinks posts closely, its hard to pick out exact positon .. i wanted to send antares down into the caverns    [pfly] - or any number of things.... scotto has written lots of little blurbs about the horrosrs inside    [pfly] - 23babies, yeah    [cris] - but she might already be at infinitek    [pfly] - antares is supposedly with slade etc..    [pfly] - although i had the feeling that was turning into a "not-antares"... kinda fuzzy    [cris] - the entity, having chosen a corporation as its avatar, would have to be somewhat suppressable just by the CEPO meme itself*** jeraway (~jer@thorazine.neuron.net) has joined channel #scrytch    [yara] - what entity?*** jeraway is now known as jer    [yara] - hey jer, are the 23 babies trying to destroy Infinitek or just take it oveR?    [pfly] - the building itself could fight back    [cris] - theres antares proper and the muse snuck into the plane w/yara & db disguised as antares    [jer] - they *did* take it over    [pfly] - ohh!    [pfly] - there have been scenes of anarchy inside written recently    [yara] - hmmm hmm. i'll have to think about this    [jer] - but the company itself is the personification of a cuthulu-style entity* yara debates going to the mtg vs. going to the gym    [pfly] - but now i recall the takeoverposts    [cris] - the muse morphed into a snakeish thing to be able to slither down into the bowels of the building faster     [yara] - ok. i'll have to think about this* yara heads off to the gym    [cris] - im trying to psych up for a truly gruseome scene in the angel lab*** Signoff: yara (bbl)* jer isn't sure what's going on with the building now though, cause i haven't had a chance to read my email thoroughly    [cris] - the upper, visible levels got blowed up    [jer] - it's too bad bauler never reads the papers    [cris] - if it's an entity, it must be awfully pissed    [jer] - ;)    [jer] - i'll tell you what, the entity is fucking FURIOUS at this point    [cris] - ::)    [jer] - cause it'sno longer fully in control of itself    [cris] - hee    [cris] - why, coz scotto's not CEO anymore?    [jer] - taking the form of a corporation instead of a human being was a smart move inasmuch as it allowed for longer reach and more power    [pfly] - i think scotto got hijacked by slade & co and is going to infinitek,...even though he wanted to stay on the island    [jer] - but    [cris] - bring me the head of not-scotto, db ays ..    [jer] - the tradeoff was that it couldn't be in full control of itself at all times...it needed human puppets to help run the show    [jer] - and now, that control is in the hands of the 23    [pfly] - zombie stockholder army?    [jer] - and the 23 aren't going to be babies forever...    [jer] - i'm not sure what to do about this most recent attack on the building, though    [pfly] - i think its only going to get worse (the attack)    [cris] - ooo, 23 adults with no interpersonal conflicts    [jer] - the entity is going to be off its fucking rocker, and the babies are going to perceive it as an attempt to thwart their plans    [cris] - well, i was a thinkin, the muse is gonna be real anfry about having to dispact some of the angels out of sheer mercy    [cris] - er dispatch    [jer] - the attackers might just get hit by both the company *AND* the babies    [cris] - angry    [jer] - by the way, as i said, i haven't had a chance to catch up lately...who the hell is the muse?    [cris] - so the muse is gonna be seething with sorrow and grief & rage fairly soon    [cris] - hee    [cris] - scotto invented the muse    [pfly] - way back    [pfly] - but she's been a bit part until recently, no?    [cris] - the muse is who took away louise's name and turned her into the she as punishment for stuff    [cris] - the muse is very bit part yea*** Signoff: cris (Leaving)*** heath has changed the topic on channel #scrytch to "scotto invented the muse"    [pfly] - haha    [jer] - so is the muse an angel?    [pfly] - i think its the traditional muse    [pfly] - the greek myth muse    [pfly] - more or less*** cris (cris@xanadu.io.com) has joined channel #scrytch    [cris] - carrier drop    [cris] - so i was thinkin the muse is related to ext. in a way    [cris] - the desire to step outside life in order to communicate it in art    [heath] - re the Vodka Shake contest - idoes that relate to the scrytch slosh?  if so i really *could* make "Russian Popsicles" ...    [pfly] - or, if the muse is like, inspiration... it always comes from outside any context    [cris] - and at the same time that reflection & external context inspiring one to amplify one's life & taste it moe fully    [cris] - mmmmm [popsicles    [cris] - yea, the muse is inspiration personifies    [cris] - d    [cris] - or at least the vague tickly idea of the muse i have is    [pfly] - me too    [cris] - is why the muse associates so closely with ange;s    [heath] - oh; does anyone have any comments on the categories provisionally listed at     [heath] - http://www.neuron.net/~rez/  ?    [cris] - i recall thinking they seemes to cover it at this juncture    [pfly] - it looked good to me... i was working on a scrytch picture for possible use as an imagemap of links...    [pfly] - hey heath    [cris] - when scotto approached me to write something about antares doin' aeute i have to admit i was a little grumply    [pfly] - i like the idea of planning and making a sctychweb that is planned organic... easy to add to, and seemingly working even if "not done", etc    [pfly] - aeute?    [cris] - but i guess its good to be understood enought to be critiqued ..    [cris] - i like that too, the evolving scrytchweb    [pfly] - i think it would be cool to have links running off into endless shuffle links and stuff    [cris] - aeute - the false sentiment or false memory angel    [pfly] - as we find connections, we can link them up into an ever more complex web    [heath] - [the End God of False Memories]    [cris] - yea    [pfly] - but also have solid texts like psychdegraddable and interlace    [cris] - ooo, kinda like the scrytch trading card game    [heath] - paul - i agree.  that's why i want to figure out a generic classification structure..      [pfly] - i remember liking your site...      [heath] - yup, those would go into a section devoted to "distillate corpii" or somesuch..    [heath] - i do too, cris, i should make it a Section.  :)    [pfly] - my idea was to someday make a funky picture with links embedded in it that lead off into a chaotic network of bits    [cris] - ::)    [cris] - i like hat    [cris] - that    [pfly] - i have some qabalah imagemaps i made a while back that might be fun    [cris] - generic classification structure?    [heath] - yara - did you say that irc work 35 & 36 were up?    [heath] - cris - no, but rather, one honed to the needs of scrytch; a concept in Archival..:    [heath] - "Provenance" with a soft e..    [heath] - it means, "analyze the collection to be organized, and let *it* show you the best way to organize it.    [heath] - start grouping like with like, until you have enough rough categories that structure emerges.  a weird but very cool idea.    [cris] - heath, you are aware that  ..    [pfly] - it would be nice if all of us could access the site and edit it ourselves?  you think?    [heath] - it is used by archivists who are given very large and specialized collections, like say    [cris] - argh!  i just got called into a one on one meeting w/supervisor re: upcoming projects    [heath] - the materials froma famous family, to organize for presentation or access.    [cris] - i'll read the log for this, so ... seeya in text  :)*** cris has left channel #scrytch    [heath] - well paul, a part of me really wants to be able to devote autonym.com to this...    [heath] -

well, we have plenty of time to work out the site and details before Amir returns..    [pfly] - yeah... i'm going to continue to work on my graphics    [heath] - and, it cld be that we want to secure scrytch.org or something, though i'm willing to dedicate autonym.com if it's desired and it's already there..    [heath] -

it was a nightmare for autonym.com and that was just me; gii.net was torturous and drawn out    [cris] - is scrytch still available?    [cris] - why all the trouble with autonym?    [pfly] - aren't .org easier?    [heath] - one'd assume so cris..  one cld check at internic    [cris] - i think neuron/~scrytch wouldnt be so horrible either    [heath] - just the hassle with registering a domain name period.  getting the 3 necessary contacts, preparing the billing info..    [heath] -

format a page to be just like the ones you set up, and starting with 035,    [heath] - have you link from 034 to there in "Next" .  that way i can deal with both adding the    [heath] - html version and also archiving the rawtxt version each couple nights.    [heath] -
