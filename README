StegParty 0.2 README
====================

StegParty is a system for hiding information inside of plain-text files.
For more information, read stegparty.txt and base27.txt.

This software (except for the test/*.txt files) is under the GPL -- see the
LICENSE file for more info.


Prerequisites:

- C compiler
- flex
- GNU Make
- Perl
- gzip (to run the tests)
- a text editor (to edit the Makefile when things don't work ;-) )


To get started:

- Try this:

	gmake
	gmake test

- You may have to alter the LIBS line in the Makefile, and the
  "#!/usr/bin/perl" line in the scripts.  Also, you may not have
  gmake (GNU Make).

- Also try this:

	echo "Secret message" | ./base27 > secret.txt
	./stegparty -c secret.txt < my_email_msg.txt > encoded.txt
	./stegparty -d < encoded.txt | ./base27 -d

You'll have to provide your own "secret.txt" and "encoded.txt", of
course...

Be careful out there!
