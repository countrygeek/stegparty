BASE27(1)                                               BASE27(1)


NAME
       base27 - converts text into a different base

SYNOPSIS
       base27 [ -d ] [ -C codestr ] infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       base27  is  intended  to compress small amounts of textual
       data (under 100 characters) by converting it to a  differ-
       ent  base  --  by  default this is base 27, meaning it can
       encode all uppercase alphabetic characters and whitespace.
       All  lowercase  characters  are uppercased, and characters
       that cannot be converted are stripped.

       You can encode/decode  different  sets  of  characters  by
       passing  an  argument  to  the  -C parameter; for instance
       passing -C '01' will encode/decode binary strings.

OPTIONS
       -d          Decode text previously encoded using this pro-
                   gram.

       -C          Set  the  code  string to be used.  The number
                   base is set to the  number  of  characters  in
                   this   string.  The  default  is  "@ABCDEFGHI-
                   JKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".

       -u          Do not convert  to  uppercase  when  encoding.
                   This  would  be  used  if lowercase characters
                   were present in the code string.
